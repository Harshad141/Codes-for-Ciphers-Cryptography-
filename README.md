## Cryptography:-
> Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it. The pre-fix "crypt" means "hidden" or "vault" and the suffix "graphy" stands for "writing."
### There are many _Cryptographic algorithms_ also known as _CIPHERS_, codes for some of them are mentioned in this repository.

- **Hill Cipher
- **Affine Cipher
